# Code Vulnerability Detection

## Overview

CATastrophe's vulnerability detection system combines machine learning with traditional code analysis techniques to identify security vulnerabilities in Python source code. The system is designed to detect various vulnerability types while minimizing false positives.

## Vulnerability Categories

### 1. Injection Vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection**: Unsafe database queries with user input
- **Command Injection**: System command execution with untrusted data
- **Code Injection**: Dynamic code execution (eval, exec)

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Passwords or API keys in source code
- **Weak Cryptography**: Use of deprecated or insecure algorithms
- **Missing Authentication**: Unprotected sensitive operations

### 3. Data Exposure
- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive data in logs or error messages
- **Path Traversal**: Unsafe file operations
- **Insecure Deserialization**: Pickle/YAML with untrusted data

### 4. Input Validation
- **Missing Validation**: Unvalidated user inputs
- **Type Confusion**: Incorrect type assumptions
- **Buffer Overflows**: Unsafe memory operations

## Detection Pipeline

### 1. Code Preprocessing
```python
def preprocess_code(code_string):
    # Remove comments and docstrings
    # Normalize whitespace
    # Extract relevant code segments
    return processed_code
```

### 2. Feature Extraction
The system extracts multiple feature types:

#### Lexical Features
- Token frequencies
- Keyword patterns
- String literal analysis
- Import statements

#### Syntactic Features
- AST node types and frequencies
- Control flow complexity
- Function call patterns
- Variable usage patterns

#### Semantic Features
- Data flow analysis
- Taint propagation
- Type inference
- API usage patterns

### 3. Vectorization
```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=2000,
    token_pattern=r'\b\w+\b',
    ngram_range=(1, 2)
)
```

### 4. Anomaly Scoring
The autoencoder produces a reconstruction error score:
- **Score < 0.3**: Likely safe
- **Score 0.3-0.5**: Requires review
- **Score > 0.5**: Likely vulnerable

## Integration with Development Workflow

### GitHub Bot Integration
The system includes a GitHub bot that:
1. Monitors pull requests
2. Analyzes changed Python files
3. Comments with vulnerability reports
4. Provides actionable feedback

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
- name: Run CATastrophe Analysis
  run: |
    python -m catastrphe.predict --dir src/
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Vulnerabilities detected!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Training Data Quality
- Use diverse, well-labeled vulnerability datasets
- Include both vulnerable and secure code examples
- Regular model updates with new vulnerability patterns

### 2. Threshold Tuning
- Adjust detection threshold based on:
  - Project security requirements
  - Acceptable false positive rate
  - Development stage (stricter for production)

### 3. Human Review
- Always review high-severity findings
- Use tool output as guidance, not absolute truth
- Combine with other security tools

## Limitations and Considerations

### Known Limitations
1. **Language Specific**: Currently only supports Python
2. **Context Window**: Limited to file-level analysis
3. **Novel Vulnerabilities**: May miss completely new patterns

### False Positives
Common sources include:
- Legitimate use of dangerous functions
- Test code with mock vulnerabilities
- Framework-specific secure patterns

### Performance Impact
- Analysis time: ~0.5-2 seconds per file
- Memory usage: ~500MB for model loading
- GPU acceleration recommended for large codebases

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-language Support**: Extend to JavaScript, Java, C++
2. **Cross-file Analysis**: Track data flow across modules
3. **Explainable AI**: Provide detailed reasoning for detections
4. **Active Learning**: Incorporate user feedback for model improvement
